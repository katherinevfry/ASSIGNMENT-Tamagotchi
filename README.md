## Description of the user
The user is likely a millennial who wants to relive the glory days of their youth and take care of a Tamagotchi-style digital pet.
## List of features
- Four game areas - eat, play, sleep, and fight
- The eat area displays a different food depending on which button the user clicks: either a healthy food or unhealthy food.
- The play area generates a random activity for the user's pet. The points go up or down depending on how fun the activity is.
- The sleep area allows the user to put their pet to bed for the night or take a nap
- The fighting area allows the user to select whether their pet will run away of commit an act of violence. Only running away bravely allows the user's pet to gain points.
- The user cannot go over 100 points in each game area. If the user attempts to do so, a message will display, alerting the user they have attempted to exceed the limit.
